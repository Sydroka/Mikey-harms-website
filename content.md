## About Mikey Harms

Mikey Harms is a Chicago-based singer-songwriter blending alternative folk and alternative rock into songs that feel intimate, restless, and unfiltered. His music balances raw emotion with sharp songwriting, pulling from quiet introspection and explosive release in equal measure. Whether stripped down or fully charged, Mikey's sound lives in the tension between vulnerability and defiance — honest, human, and a little unpolished on purpose — drawing listeners in with lyrics that linger and melodies that stick around longer than expected.
